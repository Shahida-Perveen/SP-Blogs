## My Experiments with Videography    


Last semester, I had my first experience in making videos. I had to make couple of videos for a course that I took in my Master's degree. I thought, it would be fun to showcase my not so perfect *experiments* with you all.    

So, brace yourself...      

### Beauty as I know it     


I was suppose to make a video on any subject of my choice, so I decided to make this one. It is filmed, edited and scripted by yours truly. Hope you like it :)

### Stop Motion Video    

I also made a *Stop Motion Video*
