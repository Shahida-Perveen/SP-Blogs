# Digital Humanities as per my understanding...      



In the early 2000s with explosive development in Communications Technologies and the digital Revolution emerged a new discipline **Digital Humanities**. In DH, digital Technologies intersect with Humanities in the most interesting ways. This approach has new relevance in the context of the covid-19 that has probably dealt a knockout blow to the traditional approaches in education. Today, students have to break free from the tyranny of the printed text and move confidently into the fluid dynamics of interdisciplinarity.   

It is from the field of Humanities computing that *Digital Humanities* emerged in the 1940s and 50s. DH is a crossover discipline connecting the Social Sciences like history and philosophy, archaeology and anthropology, statistics, linguistics, literature, library and information science, media studies design and what not. In the constantly growing and changing fields of *Digital Humanities*, technology and science are no longer two separate disciplines, they are two sides of the same approach. DH is a two-way approach to the systematic use of digital resources in Humanities and the humanistic analysis of the application of digital resources.    


To me **Digital Humanities** is not a field, some people define DH as the application of computational technology and methods to humanities problems. I think DH is a community bridge or space where people from different disciplines and backgrounds come together to learn how to talk to each other and to effectively combine skills to conduct joint and interdisciplinary research.    


For example take the discipline of history. A digital Humanities approach to history involves developing new analytical approaches to history regarding creation, documentation, preservation, curation and developing digital tools for data mining, data mapping, hypertextualization, Information retrieval, visualisation etc. Being a student of *Digital Humanities* involves much more than the digitisation of existing documents and processes and requires you to develop a set of approaches to be engaged in an exciting and challenging combination of tasks such as creation, computation, curation and analysis.     

Graduates and postgraduates in digital Humanities may work with web designing, software programming, technical writing, game studies, etc. and can embark on new age professions like data manager, data designer, digital curator, cultural designer, information architect, data scientist, and metadata analyst.   


Some of the significant digital Humanities projects that have been taken up by different universities are:   

- [Mapping the republic of letters of Stanford humanities centre](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/)
- [Women writers project of the Northeastern University in Boston](https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/#:~:text=The%20Women%20Writers%20Project%20is,scholars%2C%20and%20the%20general%20reader.) 
- [Perseus Project of Tufts University](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/)
- [The Global Shakespeare and performance archive](https://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/)
- [The William Blake Archive](http://www.blakearchive.org/) 
  


Other interesting projects include curating digital exhibitions and museums on anything ranging from painting and music to food, spatial history projects, projects on related disciplines like medical Humanities astrobiology etc.    

In short, Digital  Humanities tries to put people in a better position to understand unknown or difficult disciplines or topics. So, what are you waiting for?
